## Installation and Setup Instructions

Installation:


cd into /server and run `npm run magic` --> This will install the dependencies for front and backend, create a `data` folder with a `db.sqlite` database file. This script will also run the frontend scripts concurrent with the backend server

If you kill the terminal and wish to re-run the project after dependencies have been intalled run `npm run dev` to run front and backend scripts without re-installing dependencies

This app was built with React, Nodejs, Express, Sqlite, Typeorm and SASS.
